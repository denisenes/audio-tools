Just a small application that I am writing in order to study digital audio processing.

Now it can:
1) Read and write audio files in WAV format
2) Generate some simple waves (sin, square, triangle, saw[almost])
3) Mix several waves
4) ADSR envelope

Future plans:
1) Fast Fourier transform
2) frequency filter
3) LFO (with different modes)
4) MIDI support
5) real-time processing
and other interesting things
